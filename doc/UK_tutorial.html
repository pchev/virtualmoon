view as close as possible to what you will see in the eyepiece, check
the "P<span style="font-weight: bold;">hase with dynamic relief</span>"
box which will introduce shadows into the craters at the terminator. In
this case, you will not be able to choose any other texture to apply.<br><br>
If you want to choose a specific texture to apply, you must check the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Phase without relief</span>"
box. Then choose the texture you want to see displayed according to the
zoom level by checking the boxes in the matrix. You will see that some
textures only go up to level 8 while others go up to 200. We refer you
to the VMA manual for the descriptions and the advantages of each
texture.<br><br>Finally, if you simply want to study certain physical
quantities (Concentration in elements, gravimetry, neutron fluxes,

order of magnification. By clicking one or more times in the right
columns, you can activate (Green) or deactivate (Red) the right / left
inversion (&lt;-&gt;) or up / down inversion (N / S) functions. So if

recommend 10 mm to be able to show everything on the same page. The "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Information text width</span>"
slider allows you to choose the size of the characters used to print

the correct setting for your printer.<br><br>Check the boxes for the

This includes an interesting tool for the final configuration. At the bottom of the frame, you see a "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh ... fps</span>" frames per second counter. The higher the number, the smoother the display.<br><br>Drag the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Penumbra</span>"
slider and choose the degree of transparency that you like best. But be
aware that the display is a little faster when the dark part is
completely black.<br><br>Slide the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diffuse</span>" tab to the left. It manages the general quality of the map rendering.<br><br>Slide the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Specular</span>"
tab to the left. It manages the width of the lighting blur at the
terminator. The display gains speed if it is positioned to the left.<br><br>But the setting that most influences the fluidity of the display is the one set by the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Smoothness</span>"
slider. This cursor is used to manage the precision of the sphere on
which the surface texture is applied. Placed completely to the left, it
is no longer even a sphere, but a faceted polyhedron.<br><br>By moving
the cursor to the right, you increase the number of these facets, but
this setting also becomes increasingly greedy in material resources.
However, it is better to go towards a higher spherical resolution
because this influences the accuracy of the pointing of the formations
on the map.<br><br>You now need to play on these different sliders to
obtain an acceptable compromise between definition and fluidity. It is
not recommended to go below a display rate of 4 fps as this may block
the computer.<br><br>It is better not to apply "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Texture compression</span>". You can also check the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Anti-Alias</span>" box to improve the quality of the map, but this will have an impact on the fluidity of the display.<br><br>To finish, click on the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tools</span>" tab on the right. Check the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">South</span>" box in the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Default orientation</span>"
frame if you are using a Newton telescope so that the display is
oriented like the view in this type of telescope. Or otherwise just
tick the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mirror</span>" box if you
are using a refractor, a Maksutov telescope or a Schmidt - Cassegrain
telescope. If neither of these two boxes is checked, the Moon will be
represented as it is seen with the naked eye or with binoculars.<br>
      <br>
If you use an instrument on an azimutal mount or a Dobsonian telescope, check the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Local zenith on top</span>" box.<br><br>Once these settings have been made, you can use the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Virtual Moon Atlas</span>" effectively. Of course, you can modify them at any time to suit your specific needs.</span><br>

In addition, the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mark selection on map</span>" function will launch the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">ATLUN</span> (c) module with all the formations you have selected clearly
located on the map.<br>

The manual of the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Virtual Moon Atlas</span>" includes the lists

      </div>
      <br>With <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">DATLUN</span> (c), the data manager of the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Virtual Moon Atlas</span>", you can also carry out studies on lunar toponymy.<br>
      <br>
Patrick Chevalley has chosen to base <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">DATLUN</span> (c) on the powerful SQL
language so that it can generate very sophisticated multi-criteria
queries.<br>
      <br>
In addition, the information entered into the databases by Christian
Legrand is from the start "calibrated" to allow very precise searches.<br>
      <br>
The combination of these two factors allows you to select, for example,
the named formations whose name is taken from characters having the
same characteristics, for example:<br>
      <br>
- Characters who lived in the 18th century<br>
- Characters who are Americanh mathematicians or physicists (or of any other nationality)<br>
- Characters who made studies about light (For example)<br>
- The craters whose character names have been assigned by Julius Schmidt<br>
- Characters who were born in a given city or in a given birth year<br>
- The formations on the Langrenus map.<br>
- etc ...<br>
      <br>
In addition, the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mark selection on map</span>" function will launch the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">ATLUN</span> (c) module with all the formations you have selected clearly

      <br>Start
the program. Go to the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Configuration</span>" menu. Select the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Textures</span>" tab.
On the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Historical</span>" line of the table, select the historical texture you
want to study from the drop-down list. Click on the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">OK</span>" button. The
historical texture becomes the basic texture. We also suggest that you
remove the phase and libration which are of no use in this research using the adequate buttons in the buttons bar.<br>
      <br>
By clicking on the "Full Globe" button, you will be able to rotate the
lunar globe by clicking on it with the left mouse button that you leave
pressed. Of course, the Farside of the Moon is not mapped.<br>
      <br>
Click on the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Information</span>" tab. Enter the
name of the desired formation in the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Find</span>" area. Press the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Find</span>"
button.<br>
      <br>
The formation is then centered on the map on the historical map. Move
the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Zoom</span>" slider to magnify the map as desired. Press the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Center</span>"
button to center the chosen formation in the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Map</span>" window. It is likely
that the label of the formation is not located on it given the
uncertainties of the drawings made at these times.<br>
      <br>
By pressing the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">2nd Window</span>" button, you can bring up a new window and
adjust the display with another texture as before, allowing you to
conduct particularly enriching comparative studies.<br>
      <br>
The active window is surrounded by a red border. Just click on one of the two windows to make it active.<br>

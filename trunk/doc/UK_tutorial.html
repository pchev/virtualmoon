      <p>A good setting of the &quot;Virtual Atlas of the Moon&quot; is necessary 
        to better use all its features.</p>
      <p>The authors have wished this software to be usable by the greatest number 
        of people despite of the machine resources needed. This is why there are 
        somme settings to do.</p>
      <p>Owners of the most powerful computers will access all the functions in 
        great comfort. The speeder the microprocessor, the more graphic memory 
        inside and better will be the resolution and shorter the computing time.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><b>1) Your computer has a graphic section which is not Open 
        GL compatible (Version &quot;Light&quot;)</b></p>
      <p align="left">Your computer is build around a less than 300 Mhz microprocessor, 
        or your graphic section is less than 16 Mo video RAM , or this one doesn't 
        support Open GL library ? Unfortunetely, you will not be able to use 3D 
        display. <b>You must choose the &quot;Light&quot; version.</b></p>
      <p align="left">You will be able to use only 2D maps including nevertheless 
        the included geological 2D map.</p>
      <p align="left">After launching the software, click on the &quot;Configuration&quot; 
        menu. Click on the &quot;General thumbnail&quot;. To make easier all the 
        calculations, we advise you to choose the &quot;Geocentric position&quot; 
        option which is less greedy for smaller configurations.</p>
      <p align="left">Then, choose the language. It's the language of the software 
        and of the database and French and English are provided in the basic package. 
        In the other languages versions produced by others volontary colleagues, 
        it's often only the software interface. Some databases have been translated 
        too in some languages.</p>
      <p align="left">Then click on the &quot;Display&quot; thumbnail. Don't click 
        in the &quot;Use Open GL display&quot;. But you can fill the &quot;Show 
        the phase&quot; and &quot;Geological map&quot; boxes.</p>
      <p align="left">You must after test the textures resolution beginning with 
        &quot; Quart&quot;. As you can see, this texture is very rough and it 
        shows only what is visible in a 10x binoculars. Contrarly, the &quot;Full&quot; 
        resolution shows you what is visible in a 60 mm (2,5 &quot;) instrument. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">Once the texture choosen, you can also apply your favorite 
        color to the point showing the formation on the map, the name of the selected 
        formation and the color of the name of the neighbourhood or principal 
        formations. You can also decide if you want to display them if you fill 
        or unfill the &quot;Show label&quot; or &quot;Show marks&quot; boxes.</p>
      <p align="left"></p>
      <p align="left"></p>
      <p align="left">If you fill the &quot;Mark the point of the maximum libration&quot;, 
        a well visible point will be displayed around the lunar disk to show you, 
        despite of the 2D display, where the libration will be maximum for the 
        date and hour that you will select soon.</p>
      <p align="left">The &quot;Label size&quot; cursor allows you to magnify 
        or reduce the names formations police size on the displayed maps or when 
        printing them. The &quot;Label density&quot; cursor allows you to increase 
        or reduce the number of names formations displayed at the same time on 
        the map.</p>
      <p align="left">Now, click on the &quot;Images&quot; thumbnail. You can 
        choose the number of displayed together images windows with the upper 
        tuning. Downside, you will find the images directories list. The downloadable 
        pictures library allows you to have several directories, one for LOPAM 
        pictures, one for Apollo's, one for Clementine's, one for those of other 
        probes. And you can after add one for your own pictures and others as 
        you want.</p>
      <p align="left">Now click on the &quot;Eyepieces&quot; thumbnail. Type in 
        your eyepieces list. Fill the &quot;Field&quot; column and help yourself 
        with the &quot;Compute&quot; button above. We think it's a good option 
        to sort your eyepieces and combinations from the less to the more powerful. 
        If you click on the right columns, you can activate (Green) or deactivate 
        (Red) the &quot;left-right&quot; (&lt;-&gt;) inversion and the &quot;up-down&quot; 
        (N/S) inversion. So, if you own a Newtonian and a refractor, for example, 
        you can program the exact views that each of these instruments will gives 
        you. </p>
      <p align="left">After that, click on the &quot;Printing&quot; thumbnail. 
        First, define the documents margin. We advise you to choose 10 mm, so 
        that all the documents according to a single formation could be printed 
        on a single page. The &quot;Description text width&quot; allows you to 
        choose database datas printing police size. Here, we advise you to try 
        several sizes and choose the best.</p>
      <p align="left">Fill the boxes of the documents you want to print. The three 
        documents can be printed on the same page if you use a sufficiently small 
        police size. We advise you to fill the &quot;White background&quot; box 
        to reduce printing ink quantity when printing maps.</p>
      <p align="left">Now click on the &quot;Settings&quot; thumbnail to the right. 
        Slide the &quot;Penumbra&quot; cursor to choose the transparency degree 
        of the night side. You can replace the darkening of the night side by 
        lines when clicking the box.</p>
      <p align="left">Click on the &quot;Tools&quot; thumbnail on the right. Fill 
        the &quot;South&quot; box if you use a Newtonian so that the map display 
        will be as you can see the Moon in your telescope. Or fill the &quot;North&quot; 
        and the &quot;Mirror&quot; boxes if you use a refractor or a Maksutov 
        or a Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope.</p>
      <p align="left">Validate your choices clicking on the &quot;OK&quot; button. 
        You can now enjoy all the power of the Virtual Moon Atlas &quot;Light&quot; 
        version. </p>

      <p>Click on the &quot;Settings&quot; thumbnail. This one presents an interesting

      <p>But the most influent cursor on display speed is the &quot;Resolution&quot; 
        cursor. This cursor sets the 3D sphere precision on which is applied the

        on the Moon.</p>
      <p>First of all be sure that you have installed the good ASCOM drivers on

      <p>This example is appliable to all computers, with 2D or 3D display.</p>
      <p>Start the software. We will choose for our example the &quot;Alphonsus&quot; 
        crater that your new information has just revealed you an interesting 
        detail. </p>
      <p>As you now well where is Alphonsus, just slide the upper zoom cursor 
        to half its way. You can also use your mouse wheel if you own one. The 
        2D map or 3D lunar globe magnifies.</p>
      <p>Click on the map or globe with left button, stay clicked and move the 
        mouse to move simultaneously the map, as grabing it, to center Alphonsus. 
        It's is now visible and you click in its center. Its name is displayed 
        confirming you that you were right. If you made a mistake, you have just

      <p>When you identify Alphonsus, use the &quot;Center&quot; button. Then, 
        map shows you that it's a not too old crater with a central peak and pretty 
        high walls.</p>
      <p>You can read all the detailed informations about it in the right window. 
        You will find here informations about the origin of its name, on its position, 
        its dimensions, a complete description and observing advices.</p>
      <p>Note also the &quot;Profile&quot; frame above the right window that gives 
        a good idea of a cut of this crater.</p>
      <p>For a well understanding of the description, click on the &quot;Picture&quot; 
        button. Remarkably detailed pictures extracted from the VMA pictures library. 
        Click on the one you want to display and it appears in an independant

      <p>The picture shows you well the black dots, the central peak and the rilles 
        indicated in the description and even more if you consider all the craterlets 
        visible on it. And some of the pictures of Ranger 9 show you 50 m details

      <p>The problem is to search a formation located in the librations zone which 
        only periodically visible. We will use the famous &quot;MARE ORIENTALE&quot; 
        ... which is on the East side of the visible face , but now on the West 
        part since the International Astronomical Union has changed the orientation 
        of lunar maps.</p>
      <p>Start the program. Click on the &quot;Position&quot; thumbnail. In the

        You will find here informations about the origin of its name, onits position,

      <p>For a well understanding of the description, click on the &quot;Picture&quot; 
        button. A remarkably detailed picture extracted from &quot;Digital Lunar 
        Orbiter Photographic Atlas of the Moon&quot; published by Jeff Gillis 
        of&quot;Lunar and Planetary Institute&quot; shows you an amount of details 
        above all what is visible in the best terrestrial instruments.</p>
      <p>You can adjust the picture size and definition using &quot;Zoom +&quot; 
        and &quot;Zoom -&quot; buttons of its window. Lifters are used when it's 
        too big to fit in the main window.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>This picture shows you Mare Orientale in a way impossible to observe 
        from Earth, because as the major part of the photos of LOPAM, it has been 
        taken vertically.</p>
      <p>Close now the picture window with a click on its &quot;Close&quot; button 
        to come back to the globe.</p>
      <p>Click on the &quot;Configuration&quot; menu, than on the &quot;Display&quot; 
        thumbnail and activate &quot;Open GL display&quot;, &quot;Phase&quot; 
        and &quot;Libration&quot; boxes if it's not yet done.</p>
      <p>Click on the &quot;Ephemerisis&quot; thumbnail and with the &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; 
        button, go in the future to a one day per click rate.</p>
      <p>You will then witness the slow move of the lunar globe and the terminator 
        path. Note the arrow showing you the place where the libration is maximum 
        and how its size varies with the libration intensity.</p>
      <p>Observe as Mare Orientale is from times to times more visible. A good 
        observing period will be when the position is good and on a Full Moon 
        day.</p>
      <p>With a sufficient clicks number, you will find a such day in the future. 
        it will be indicated in the date boxes above the videorecorder buttons. 
        Look at the hour to confirm it's not during the day. Now, you have just 
        to wish that you will be free on this night and that meteorology will 
        be favorable !</p>

        with all the selected formations clearly localized.</p>
      <p>We propose you to read the illustrated &quot;<b>DATLUN</b>&quot; manual 
        for more informations.</p>

      <p align="left">With &quot;<b>DATLUN</b>&quot; (c), the VMA databases manager, 
        you can also study the origin of lunar names. </p>
      <p>Patrick Chevalley has choosen to build <b>DATLUN</b> on <b>SQL</b> language 
        so that it will be possible to generate elaborated multicriterias requests. 
      </p>
      <p>And more, the informations entered in the databases by Christian Legrand 
        are always &quot;<b>formated</b>&quot; permiting precise requests. </p>
      <p>These two factors conjuction allows you to select, for example lists 
        of formations with characters names presenting the same features such 
        as :</p>
      <p>- Characters living during the 18th century.<br>
        - English mathematicians or physicists (Or from any other country).<br>
        - Characters who have study the light.<br>
        - Craters whose character's name has been applied by Schmidt.<br>
        - Characters who are born in a specific town.<br>
        - Formations present on Langrenus map.<br>
        - etc...</p>
      <p>It's the first time that a such tool is proposed for lunar observers.</p>

			<P>A good setting of the &quot;Virtual Atlas of the Moon&quot; is
			necessary to better use all its features.</P>
			<P>The authors have wished this software to be usable by the
			greatest number of people despite of the machine resources needed.
			This is why there are some settings to do.</P>
			<P>Owners of the most powerful computers will access all the
			functions in great comfort. The speeder the microprocessor, the
			more graphic memory inside and better will be the resolution and
			shorter the computing time.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>1) Your computer has a graphic section which is
			not Open GL compatible (Version &quot;Light&quot;)</B></P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Your computer is build around a less than 300 MHz
			microprocessor, or your graphic section is less than 16 Mo video
			RAM , or this one doesn't support Open GL library ? Unfortunately,
			you will not be able to use 3D display. <B>You must choose the
			&quot;Light&quot; version.</B></P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>You will be able to use only 2D maps including
			nevertheless the included geological 2D map.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>After launching the software, click on the
			&quot;Configuration&quot; menu. Click on the &quot;General
			thumbnail&quot;. To make easier all the calculations, we advise
			you to choose the &quot;Geocentric position&quot; option which is
			less greedy for smaller configurations.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Then, choose the language. It's the language of the
			software and of the database and French and English are provided
			in the basic package. In the other languages versions produced by
			others voluntary colleagues, it's often only the software
			interface. Some databases have been translated too in some
			languages.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Then click on the &quot;Display&quot; thumbnail.
			Don't click in the &quot;Use Open GL display&quot;. But you can
			fill the &quot;Show the phase&quot; and &quot;Geological map&quot;
			boxes.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>You must after test the textures resolution
			beginning with &quot; Quart&quot;. As you can see, this texture is
			very rough and it shows only what is visible in a 10x binoculars.
			Contrarily, the &quot;Full&quot; resolution shows you what is
			visible in a 60 mm (2,5 &quot;) instrument. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Once the texture chosen, you can also apply your
			favorite color to the point showing the formation on the map, the
			name of the selected formation and the color of the name of the
			neighborhood or principal formations. You can also decide if you
			want to display them if you fill or unfill the &quot;Show label&quot;
			or &quot;Show marks&quot; boxes.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>If you fill the &quot;Mark the point of the maximum
			libration&quot;, a well visible point will be displayed around the
			lunar disk to show you, despite of the 2D display, where the
			libration will be maximum for the date and hour that you will
			select soon.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>The &quot;Label size&quot; cursor allows you to
			magnify or reduce the names formations police size on the
			displayed maps or when printing them. The &quot;Label density&quot;
			cursor allows you to increase or reduce the number of names
			formations displayed at the same time on the map.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Now, click on the &quot;Images&quot; thumbnail. You
			can choose the number of displayed together images windows with
			the upper tuning. Downside, you will find the images directories
			list. The downloadable pictures library allows you to have several
			directories, one for LOPAM pictures, one for Apollo's, one for
			Clementine's, one for those of other probes. And you can after add
			one for your own pictures and others as you want.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Now click on the &quot;Eyepieces&quot; thumbnail.
			Type in your eyepieces list. Fill the &quot;Field&quot; column and
			help yourself with the &quot;Compute&quot; button above. We think
			it's a good option to sort your eyepieces and combinations from
			the less to the more powerful. If you click on the right columns,
			you can activate (Green) or deactivate (Red) the &quot;left-right&quot;
			(&lt;-&gt;) inversion and the &quot;up-down&quot; (N/S) inversion.
			So, if you own a Newtonian and a refractor, for example, you can
			program the exact views that each of these instruments will gives
			you. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>After that, click on the &quot;Printing&quot;
			thumbnail. First, define the documents margin. We advise you to
			choose 10 mm, so that all the documents according to a single
			formation could be printed on a single page. The &quot;Description
			text width&quot; allows you to choose database data printing
			police size. Here, we advise you to try several sizes and choose
			the best.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Fill the boxes of the documents you want to print.
			The three documents can be printed on the same page if you use a
			sufficiently small police size. We advise you to fill the &quot;White
			background&quot; box to reduce printing ink quantity when printing
			maps.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Now click on the &quot;Settings&quot; thumbnail to
			the right. Slide the &quot;Penumbra&quot; cursor to choose the
			transparency degree of the night side. You can replace the
			darkening of the night side by lines when clicking the box.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Click on the &quot;Tools&quot; thumbnail on the
			right. Fill the &quot;South&quot; box if you use a Newtonian so
			that the map display will be as you can see the Moon in your
			telescope. Or fill the &quot;North&quot; and the &quot;Mirror&quot;
			boxes if you use a refractor or a Maksutov or a Schmidt-Cassegrain
			telescope.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Validate your choices clicking on the &quot;OK&quot;

			you when using the <B>&quot;Basic&quot;</B> version and the Far
			Side viewing when using the <B>&quot;Expert&quot; version. </B>.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>After launching the software, click on the
			&quot;Configuration&quot; menu. Click on the &quot;General
			thumbnail&quot;. Because of the greater power of your computer,
			you can enter your observing site coordinates and the software
			will also compute the diurnal libration.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Then, choose the language. It's the language of the

			or &quot;Show marks&quot; boxes.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>If you fill the &quot;Mark the point of the maximum
			libration&quot;, a well visible arrow will be displayed around the
			lunar disk to show you, where the libration will be maximum for
			the date and hour that you will select soon. You will note that
			the size of this arrow is proportional to libration intensity.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>The &quot;Label size&quot; cursor allows you to
			magnify or reduce the names formations police size on the
			displayed maps or when printing them. The &quot;Label density&quot;

			available to owners of computers without support of Open GL.</P>
			<P>The problem is to search a formation located in the librations
			zone which only periodically visible. We will use the famous &quot;MARE
			ORIENTALE&quot; ... which is on the East side of the visible face
			, but now on the West part since the International Astronomical
			Union has changed the orientation of lunar maps.</P>
			<P>Start the program. Click on the &quot;Position&quot; thumbnail.
			In the input zone of the upper scrolling list, type with upper
			case letter and without any accent or &quot; ¨ &quot; :</P>
			<P>*ORIENTAL*</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>The, click on the &quot;Search&quot; button. In a
			few seconds, you can see Mare Orientale position indicated on
			South - West part of the lunar 3D globe. Maybe it's really visible
			according to the date taken by the software</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Slide the zoom cursor in its middle. The 3D lunar
			globe becomes bigger.</P>
			<P>Click on the globe with left button, stay clicked and move the
			mouse to move simultaneously the map, as grabbing it, to center
			Mare Orientale. 
			</P>
			<P>You can read all the detailed informations about it in the
			right window. You will find here informations about the origin of
			its name, its position, its dimensions, a complete description and
			observing advices.</P>
			<P>For a well understanding of the description, click on the
			&quot;Picture&quot; button. A remarkably detailed picture
			extracted from &quot;Digital Lunar Orbiter Photographic Atlas of
			the Moon&quot; published by Jeff Gillis of&quot;Lunar and
			Planetary Institute&quot; shows you an amount of details above all
			what is visible in the best terrestrial instruments.</P>
			<P>You can adjust the picture size and definition using &quot;Zoom
			+&quot; and &quot;Zoom -&quot; buttons of its window. Lifters are
			used when it's too big to fit in the main window.</P>
			<P>This picture shows you Mare Orientale in a way impossible to
			observe from Earth, because as the major part of the photos of
			LOPAM, it has been taken vertically.</P>
			<P>Close now the picture window with a click on its &quot;Close&quot;
			button to come back to the globe.</P>
			<P>Click on the &quot;Configuration&quot; menu, than on the
			&quot;Display&quot; thumbnail and activate &quot;Open GL display&quot;,
			&quot;Phase&quot; and &quot;Libration&quot; boxes if it's not yet
			done.</P>
			<P>Click on the &quot;Ephemeris&quot; thumbnail and with the &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;
			button, go in the future to a one day per click rate.</P>
			<P>You will then witness the slow move of the lunar globe and the
			terminator path. Note the arrow showing you the place where the
			libration is maximum and how its size varies with the libration
			intensity.</P>
			<P>Observe as Mare Orientale is from times to times more visible.
			A good observing period will be when the position is good and on a
			Full Moon day.</P>
			<P>With a sufficient clicks number, you will find a such day in
			the future. it will be indicated in the date boxes above the
			video-recorder buttons. Look at the hour to confirm it's not
			during the day. Now, you have just to wish that you will be free
			on this night and that meteorology will be favorable !</P>

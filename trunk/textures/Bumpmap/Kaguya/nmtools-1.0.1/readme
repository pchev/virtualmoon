This distribution contains a set of custom command-line tools for generating huge normalmap textures or texture tiles of highest quality for the space simulation Celestia, http://www.shatters.net/celestia/. No image manipulation  expertise or additional libraries are required.

Special attention has been paid to allow for very big textures (>= 64k x 32k)  to be handled even by average sized home computers. The tools work directly with the original published 16bit integer elevation maps for Earth, Mars etc. Therefore, the resulting normalmaps have a very low noise level. The execution speed is very high due to optimized custom algorithms.
 
Highlights are
 
-- sources compile cleanly for Windows and Linux PC's, 
   as well as both PPC and Intel MACs; 

-- both little-endian and big-endian 16bit elevation maps can be used;

-- executables are included for Win32, Linux, OSX-universal;

-- throughout, the tools work between STDIN and STDOUT, 
   and therefore may be piped together in a module fashion as needed;
   
-- a brief help text is printed, if the tools are executed without any
   parameters;
      
-- a detailed tutorial about how to use these tools may be found on
   http://www.celestialmatters.org
         
Specifically:
   
1) resc2pow2   
-------------
The program reads samples with signed 16-bit integers from STDIN
and outputs to STDOUT a signed 16-bit integer sample 
of width reduced to the nearest power of 2.

Specify byteswap = 1 if the byte ordering 
of input file and computer differ

   
2) halfsize
------------
The program reads textures of even height in signed 16-bit integer raw 
format from STDIN. It outputs to STDOUT a texture of size reduced by 
a factor of two in the same 16 bit raw format.

Specify byteswap = 1 if the byte ordering 
of input file and computer differ   
    
  
3) nms
-------
The program reads an elevation map in signed 16-bit raw format 
from STDIN. It outputs to STDOUT a normalmap (PPM format), for bodies of ~spherical geometry. All previously published normalmap programs (including nm16)  are incorrect for ~spherical bodies north and south of the equator.
 
4) nmstiles
------------
The program reads an elevation map in signed 16-bit raw format  
from STDIN. It directly outputs normalmap tiles (PPM format), corrected for
spherical geometry and including many optimizations. These optimizations include: the appropriate reduction of resolution for polar latitudes, correct texel normalization (r*r +g*g + b*b = 1) and the replacement of monochromatic normalmap tiles by the smallest possible 4x4 pixel tiles! The latter saves a large amount of disc space without any loss of quality.  

It is assumed that the input raw file is of power-of-two size



We cordially thank 

Da Woon Jung <dirkpitt2050@users.sf.net> 

for his active help to make the code run on MACS. He compiled the tools as "OSX-universal", meaning they contain both PPC and Intel code and run natively on both PPC and Intel MACs.   

We are also grateful to 

Chris Laurel <claurel@www.shatters.net>

for code allowing redirection of STDIN and STDOUT for Windows in case of binary file input/output.
